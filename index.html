        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Unemployment is an issue that confronts economies almost all the
          world. The levels of employment differ in different countries.
          Governments of countries try to reduce unemployment by adopting
          suitable measures to increase the number of jobs, and skill the youth
          and others to be gainfully employed. Unemployment leads to many social
          ills. There is an increase in poverty as the unemployed lack the
          purchasing power to meet their bare necessities. Poverty leads to
          beggary. There is also an increase in crime such as murder and rape in
          society due to unemployment. The unemployed also suffer from
          psychiatric conditions like depression.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          The unemployment rate reached a post during World War II to a high of
          9.7% in 1982. The data regarding unemployment and earnings was
          captured by the Department of Laborâ€™s Bureau of Labor Statistics
          (BLS). There were other reports too which mentioned the unemployment
          rate of 9.6% in the year 1983 which was due to an economic recession.
          This was after the great depression of 1983. It was in 1989 that the
          unemployment rate dropped to 5% but started enhancing again. This led
          to 6.8% in 1991 and to 7.5% in 1992. Once there was an enhancement in
          an economy, the unemployment rate fell to 6.9% in 1993. The good news
          was that the unemployment rate fell to about 4.5% in 1998 and to 4% in
          2000 which was considered as the lowest in three decades. It was in
          2001 that recession crept in and unemployment rates rose again and
          then the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, in the United States
          was also a reason of unemployment. By 2003 June, about 9.4 million was
          unemployed where the unemployment rate was elevated to 6%. There was
          again a decline in the unemployment rate from 2003 to 2007. The
          fluctuation started again and there was a rise in the year 2007 and
          the unemployment rate was 4.9% in 2008 January. People without a job
          and looking for work are counted as unemployed. It does not include
          people who have lost their jobs and not looking for it.
